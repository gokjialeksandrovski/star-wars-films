# Star Wars Films Application

A simple and elegant web application that lists Star Wars films, offering filters, sorting, infinite scrolling, and a language switcher for English and German.

## Features

- **Film List**: Displays a list of Star Wars films with the following details:
  - Episode ID
  - Title
  - Director
  - Release Date (formatted as "Month Day, Year")
  - Producers
- **Filters**:
  - Filter by Director (letters only).
  - Filter by Release Year (numbers only).
- **Sorting**:
  - Sort films by Title.
  - Sort films by Release Date.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Dynamically loads more films as the user scrolls.
- **Language Switcher**:
  - Allows users to toggle between English and German by clicking language buttons in the footer.
  - Page field names, placeholders, and text update dynamically based on the selected language.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles loading and error states with appropriate messages.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with CSS for readability and compatibility across devices.

## API Information

The application was originally designed to use the **GraphQL API** from `https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index` with Apollo Client. However, due to the API being down during development, the code was adapted to use the REST API from `https://swapi.tech`.

### GraphQL Support

The project includes commented-out code to fetch data using Apollo Client when the GraphQL API becomes available again. Simply uncomment the relevant sections and replace the REST API integration with the GraphQL queries.

## Notes

If the GraphQL API becomes available again:

1. Uncomment the Apollo Client code in `Home.tsx`, `ClientLayout.tsx`, and `apollo-client.ts`.
2. Replace the REST API calls with the GraphQL query to fetch films.
3. Ensure Apollo Client is properly configured with your API endpoint.

Enjoy exploring the galaxy of Star Wars films!
